## Dataset Used
COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. COCO has several features:

1. `Object segmentation`

2. `Recognition in context`

3. `Super pixel stuff segmentation`

4. `330K images (>200K labeled)`

5. `1.5 million object instances`

6. `80 object categories`

7. `91 stuff categories`

8. `5 captions per image`

9. `250,000 people with keypoints`
